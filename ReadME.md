# Hello!
Welcome to my GitHub repository. I am Randa. I am a research scientist not a software engineer but I use GitHub to share my projects' code of the courses I take or teach. Also I sometime share my research datasets and systems' implementation.

I used to do my research using MATLAB for years but lately I shifted to Python and open source machine learning and deep learning libraries so you may find slow activity here but I'm working on improving this.
If you find that I can help you in anyway please do not hesitate to contact me. If you wish to collaborate, I will be more than happy.

How can I help you? Well, below you can check out what I have studied and started building some experience at:
## My cerificates:
**AWS Machine learning Foundations by UDACITY**
* Credential ID: KZPPE6HL
* Certificate Link: (https://confirm.udacity.com/KZPPE6HL)
* (Certificate earned at October 12, 2021)
* In this course, you can learn the fundamentals of machine learning and learn object-oriented programming best practices.
Also you can briefly learn about computer vision with AWS DeepLens, reinforcement learning with AWS DeepRacer, and generative AI with AWS DeepComposer

**Deep Learning Nano-degree by UDACITY**
* Credential ID: HGPNF9W4
* Certificate Link: https://confirm.udacity.com/HGPNF9W4
* (Certificate earned at November 16, 2021)
* In this nano-degree you will study cutting-edge topics such as Neural Networks, Convolutional Neural Networks, Recurrent Neural Networks, Generative Adversarial Networks, and Network Deployment, and build projects in PyTorch and NumPy.
